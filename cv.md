3. From childhood, I like science and technic so nowadays I like technical tasks, quickly sort out and try to solve it. I like unusual elegant solutions in technic very much and usually adhere to the principles «everything can be done better than done so far» and «everything that is created by man can be sorted out». Every task I take to solve becomes personal challenge for me and I won’t stop before I solve it.   
Programming is interesting for me because I like to work by my head. I have an engineering education in internal combustion engines sphere and I was working by engineer-constructor for two years in Minsk Engines Plant. After two years in plant, I understood that it’s nothing to do in large Belorussian plants, but my university education can be directly used only here. So I got into automobile business and work with clients. However, I feel it is not for me and I can use my brains more effective.
